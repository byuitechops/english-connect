  <h1 class="blue">EC 3 <ins>Comparatives & Superlatives</ins></h1>

  <h2><em class="blue">Form - How are they formed?</em></h2>

  <p class="purple">
    <ins>Comparatives</ins> are formed by adding -<em>er</em> to most adjectives that have one syllable (small/small<em>er</em>) and adjectives that end in -y (pretty/pretti<em>er</em>). If an adjective has two or more syllables, usually "more" or "less" comes before it (<em>more</em> comfortable, <em>more</em> peaceful).
  </p>

  <p class="green">
    <ins>Superlatives</ins> are formed by adding -<em>est</em> to most adjectives that have one syllable (small/small<em>est</em>) and adjectives that end in -y (pretty/pretti<em>est</em>). If an adjective has two or more syllables, usually "most" or "least" comes before it (<em>most</em> comfortable, <em>most</em> peaceful).
  </p>

  <p>
    There are also some adjectives that use <em>irregular</em> forms for comparatives and superlatives. Irregular means they don't follow the predictable pattern.

  <h2><em class="blue">Meaning - what do they mean?</em></h2>

  <p class="purple">
    Comparatives compare TWO people, places, or things. Use the word "than". (He is <ins>taller <strong>than</strong></ins> her.) (This book is <ins>more interesting <strong>than</strong></ins> that book.)
  </p>

  <p class="green">
    Superlatives compare a group of THREE or more people, places, or things. Superlatives often have the word "the" before them. (She was <ins><strong>the</strong> best</ins> student in the whole class.)
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2><em class="blue">Use - when/why are they used?</em></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>We can use comparative and superlative forms in simple sentences in much the same way as we use the standard adjective forms.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>John is <ins>tall</ins>.&#10140; Peter is <ins>taller</ins>.&#10140; Fred is the <ins>tallest</ins>.</li>
      <li>It is a <ins>long flight</ins> from Auckland to Sydney.&#10140; It is a <ins>longer flight</ins> from Auckland to Honolulu.&#10140; The <ins>longest flight</ins> of the three is from Auckland to Los Angeles.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    When asking for a comparison of two, it is common to ask the question and list the two alternatives. The list usually comes at the end of the question, but it can sometimes come at the front.
  </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px">
    <em><strong>Examples:</strong></em>
    <br> Question: Who is smarter, John or Peter?
    <br> Answer: John is smarter.
    <br>
    <br> Question: Out of mathematics and economics, which is harder?
    <br> Answer: Mathematics is harder.
    <br>
    <br> Question: Which is farther from Honolulu, Los Angeles or San Francisco?
    <br> Answer: Los Angeles is a little further.
    <br>
    <br> Question: Is it better to go to a store or to shop on-line?
    <br> Answer: I prefer going to a store.
    <br>
  </p>

  <p>
    When asking for a comparison among three or more alternatives, it is common to ask the question and state the range of choice. Again, the statement of the range of alternatives usually comes at the end of the question, but it can come at the front.
  </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px">
    <em><strong>Examples:</strong></em>
    <br> Question: Who is the oldest of your children?
    <br> Answer: Tina is (the oldest).
    <br>
    <br> Question: Who is the greatest basketball player of all time?
    <br> Answer: Michael Jordan is.
    <br>
    <br> Question: Out of all the EU countries, which has the lowest birth rate?
    <br> Answer: Germany does.
    <br>
    <br> Question: Which of your children lives farthest away from you?
    <br> Answer: My oldest son lives the furthest away, in London.
    <br>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can use comparatives and superlatives with adverbs as well.
  </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px">
    <em><strong>Examples:</strong></em>
    <br> John speaks very <ins>softly</ins>.
    <br> Mary speaks <ins>more softly</ins> (than John).
    <br> Frances speaks the <ins>most softly</ins> (of all three of them).
    <br>
    <br> He thought <ins>sadly</ins> about the wreckage of his car.
    <br> He thought <ins>more sadly</ins> about the wreckage of his home.
    <br> But he thought <ins>most sadly</ins> about the wreckage of his marriage.
    <br>
    <br> Sometimes you speak <ins>more kindly</ins> to strangers <ins>than</ins> to your friends.
  </p>
